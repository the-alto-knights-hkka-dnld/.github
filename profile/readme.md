Set in the golden age of the mafia—1950s New York—*The Alto Knights* (also referred to as *Wise Guys*) chronicles the internal power struggle within the Italian-American mob families. Vito Genovese (Robert De Niro) is a cold, calculating, and ambitious figure determined to become the most powerful mob boss in the country. On the other side, Frank Costello (also De Niro) is a more diplomatic but no less powerful crime lord who values tradition over brutal ambition.

The narrative builds on the historical moment when Genovese attempted to assassinate Costello, leading to a domino effect within the Cosa Nostra. De Niro’s portrayal of both characters adds incredible depth to the film, and the duality plays out like a twisted game of chess—strategic, brutal, and poetic.
